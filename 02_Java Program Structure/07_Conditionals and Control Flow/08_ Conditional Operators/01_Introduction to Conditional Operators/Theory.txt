Conditional Operators
Introduction to Conditional Operators

Java includes operators that only use boolean values.
These conditional operators help simplify expressions containing complex boolean relationships by reducing multiple boolean values to a single value: true or false.

For example, what if we want to run a code block only if multiple conditions are true.
We could use the AND operator: &&.

Or, we want to run a code block if at least one of two conditions are true. We could use the OR operator: ||.

Finally, we can produce the opposite value, where true becomes false and false becomes true, with the NOT operator: !.

Understanding these complex relationships can feel overwhelming at first.
Luckily, truth tables, like the ones seen to the right, can assist us in determining the relationship between two boolean-based conditions.

In this lesson, we’ll explore each of these conditional operators to see how they can be implemented into our conditional statements.

Note the different conditional statements and operators that we’re using to control the execution of the program.
