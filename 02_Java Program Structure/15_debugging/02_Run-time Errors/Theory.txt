Debugging
Run-time Errors

If our program has no compile-time errors, it’ll run.
This is where the fun really starts.

Errors which happen during program execution (run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors.
Run-time errors occur when a program with no compile-time errors asks the computer to do something that the computer is unable to reliably do.

Some common run-time errors:

    Division by zero also known as division error
    Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist

There is no way for the compiler to know about these kinds of errors when the program is compiled.

Here’s an example of a run-time error message:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero at Debug.main(Debug.java:8)
Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Failed, try again

1.

There’s a run-time error in Debug.java.

This program is supposed to find the ratio of a table’s dimensions, which is supposed to be 20 x 40.

After running, you should get an error message.

$ javac Debug.java
$ java Debug
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException:
/ by zero
     at Debug.main(Debug.java:8)

What do you think the problem is?
