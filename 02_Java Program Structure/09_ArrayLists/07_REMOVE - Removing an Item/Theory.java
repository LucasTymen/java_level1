Learn Java: ArrayLists
Removing an Item

What if we wanted to get rid of an entry altogether?
For arrays, we would have to make a completely new array without the value.
==> https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/arrays

Luckily, ArrayLists allow us to remove an item by specifying the index to remove:

ArrayList<String> shoppingCart = new ArrayList<String>();

shoppingCart.add("Trench Coat");
shoppingCart.add("Tweed Houndstooth Hat");
shoppingCart.add("Magnifying Glass");

shoppingCart.remove(1);
// shoppingCart now holds ["Trench Coat", "Magnifying Glass"]

/*
We can also remove an item by specifying the value to remove:
*/

ArrayList<String> shoppingCart = new ArrayList<String>();

shoppingCart.add("Trench Coat");
shoppingCart.add("Tweed Houndstooth Hat");
shoppingCart.add("Magnifying Glass");

shoppingCart.remove("Trench Coat");
// shoppingCart now holds ["Tweed Houndstooth Hat", "Magnifying Glass"]

Note: This command removes the FIRST instance of the value "Trench Coat".
