Learn Java: Variables
Review

Creating and filling variables is a powerful concept that allows us to keep track of all kinds of data in our program.

In this lesson, we learned how to create and print several different data types in Java, which you’ll use as you create bigger and more complex programs.

We covered:

    int, which stores whole numbers.
    double, which stores bigger whole numbers and decimal numbers.
    boolean, which stores true and false.
    char, which stores single characters using single quotes.
    String, which stores multiple characters using double quotes.
    Static typing, which is one of the safety features of Java.
    Variable naming conventions.

Practice declaring variables and assigning values to make sure you have a solid foundation for learning more complicated and exciting Java concepts!
Instructions
1.

The file MyProfile.java contains a class that represents your hiring profile as presented to potential employers.

In the main() method, create a variable called name that holds your name, as a sequence of characters.

If we were defining a variable called userID that would hold a string of letters, we would use a line like this:
*/
String userID = "myUsername";
/*
You can use the same sort of declaration and initialization for your name variable!
2.

Create a variable called age that holds your age as a whole number.
3.

Create a variable called desiredSalary that holds your desired salary per year to a precision of two decimal points.

If we were defining a variable called gpa that would hold a decimal number, we would use a line like this:
*/
double gpa = 5.1;
/*
You can use the same sort of declaration and initialization for your desiredSalary variable!
4.

Create a variable called gender that holds a single character, m (male), f (female), n (for none), or o (for other).
5.

Create a variable called lookingForJob that holds whether or not you are currently open to job offers.

If we were defining a variable called isLightOn that would hold either true or false, we would use a line like this:
*/
boolean isLightOn = true;
/*
You can use the same sort of declaration and initialization for your lookingForJob variable!
