Learn Java: Variables
booleans

Often our programs face questions that can only be answered with yes or no.

Is the oven on? Is the light green? Did I eat breakfast?

These questions are answered with a boolean, a type that references one of two values: true or false.

We declare boolean variables by using the keyword boolean before the variable name.

boolean javaIsACompiledLanguage = true;
boolean javaIsACupOfCoffee = false;

/*
In future lessons, we’ll see how boolean values help navigate decisions in our programs.

Create a variable called intsCanHoldDecimals. Set it to true if the int type can hold a decimal number.
