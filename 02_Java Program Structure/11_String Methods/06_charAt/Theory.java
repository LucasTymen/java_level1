/*String Methods
charAt()

The charAt() method returns the character located at a String‘s specified index.
==> https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/strings/charAt?page_ref=catalog

For example:

String str = "qwer";

System.out.println(str.charAt(2));

It would output e because that’s what’s at index 2. (Once again, indices start with 0.)

Suppose we try to return the character located at index 4.
It would produce an IndexOutOfBoundsException error because index 4 is out of str‘s range:

java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 4

Instructions
1.

In Initials.java, add your first name and last name.

Don’t forget to put your names in the double quotes.
2.

Print out the initials of the firstName and lastName.

For example, suppose the code is:

String firstName = "Codey";
String lastName = "McCoderson";

System.out.println(firstName.charAt(0));
System.out.println(lastName.charAt(0));

It would print:

C
M
