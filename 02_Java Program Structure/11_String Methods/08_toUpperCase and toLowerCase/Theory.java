/*String Methods
toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()

There will be times when we have a word in a case other than what we need it in.

Luckily, Java has a couple String methods to help us out:

    toUpperCase(): returns the string value converted to uppercase ==> https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/strings/toUpperCase?page_ref=catalog
    toLowerCase(): returns the string value converted to lowercase ==> https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/strings/toLowerCase?page_ref=catalog

For example:

String input = "Cricket!";

String upper = input.toUpperCase();
// stores "CRICKET!"

String lower = input.toLowerCase();
// stores "cricket!"

A good use of this functionality is to ensure consistency of the data you store in a database.
Making sure all of the data you get from a user is lowercase before you store it in your database will make your database easier to search through later.
Instructions

Use System.out.println() to output values:

System.out.println(hashtag.toLowerCase());

The result should be:
