Java Review: Putting It All Together

In this lesson, we’ve started writing our first programs in Java.

We’ve also learned rules and guidelines for how to write Java programs:

    Java programs have at least one class and one main() method.
        Each class represents one real-world idea.
        The main() method runs the tasks of the program.
    Java comments add helpful context to human readers.
    Java has whitespace, curly braces, and semicolons.
        Whitespace is for humans to read code easily.
        Curly braces mark the scope of a class and method.
        Semicolons mark the end of a statement.
    Java is a compiled language.
        Compiling catches mistakes in our code.
        Compilers transform code into an executable class.

Instructions
1.

The text editor holds an empty file named Review.java. Fill it in!

Define a public class named Review.

Use opening and closing curly braces for the scope of the class.

Remember, no semicolons for classes or methods!

We define a class in Java like so:

public class MyClass {
  // class code goes here
}

2.

This code produces an error because Java programs need a main() method.

Define the main() method within the curly braces of the Review class.

Every Java program has one main() method with the following signature:

public static void main(String[] args) {
  // method code goes here
}

3.

Inside of the curly braces for the main() method, write The main method executes the tasks of the class as a single-line comment.

We create a single-line comment like so:

// Just a brief comment

4.

Below the comment, write a statement that prints the following: My first Java program from scratch!.

We can print a statement with the following syntax:

System.out.println("Blah blah blah");
