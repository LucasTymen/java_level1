Language Families

Languages, just like people, often have families. You can even map language lineage a bit like a family tree.

Java can help us build a model to track inherited traits across families. In this case, we’ll focus on something that often varies between language families: word order — where the subject, verb, and object would go in a sentence.

For example, in English, you would use subject-verb-object order:
subject 	verb 	object
She 	eats 	noodles

But in Japanese, you would use subject-object-verb order:
subject 	object 	verb
彼女は 	麺を 	食べる
(she) 	(noodles) 	(eats)

Your Language Inheritance package has three Java files:

    Language.java: for the Language parent class, which serves as the template for all languages.
    Mayan.java: for Mayan, a child class of Language modeled after the Mayan language family.
    SinoTibetan.java: for SinoTibetan, a child class of Language modeled after the Sino-Tibetan language family.

Build out a Java package with these classes to model real-world language families.

A language by any other name

1.

In Language.java, create a Language class with a main() method and the following fields:

    name: a protected string.
    numSpeakers: a protected integer.
    regionsSpoken: a protected string.
    wordOrder: a protected string.

Your code in Language.java should look something like this:
*/

class Language {

  protected String name;
  protected int numSpeakers;
  protected String regionsSpoken;

  protected String wordOrder;

  public static void main(String[] args) {

  }

}

/*
2.

Above the main() method, give Language a constructor that sets each field to the values passed in.

For example:
*/
  Language(String langName, int speakers, String regions, String wdOrder) {
    this.name = langName;
    this.numSpeakers = speakers;
    this.regionsSpoken = regions;
    this.wordOrder = wdOrder;
  }

  /*
3.

Create a public method for Language called getInfo(). We’ll use this method to display all of its information (using its field values).

The method should not return anything.

We want to set up the information like this:

[name] is spoken by [numSpeakers] people mainly in [regionsSpoken].
The language follows the word order: [wordOrder].

For example, if we call spanish.getInfo();, we’d want to see something like this:

Spanish is spoken by 555000000 people mainly in Spain, Latin America, and Equatorial Guinea.
The language follows the word order: subject-verb-object.

Here’s one way you could do this:
*/

  public void getInfo() {

    System.out.println(this.name + " is spoken by " + this.numSpeakers + " people mainly in " + this.regionsSpoken + ".");
    System.out.println("The language follows the word order: " + this.wordOrder);

    }

    /*
4.

Let’s test out the code so far!

In main(), instantiate a new Language of your choice.

Then call getInfo() on the Language variable.

Run your code in the terminal to see if the information gets printed. If nothing displays, try compiling your code first.

    For example:
*/
    Language spanish = new Language("Spanish", 555000000, "Spain, Latin America, and Equatorial Guinea", "subject-verb-object");
    spanish.getInfo();

    To run your code:

    java Language

    To compile your code:

    javac Language.java

Nice work! Now let’s model a language family.

Tab over to Mayan.java and create an empty Mayan class that inherits from Language.

Your code in Mayan.java should look something like this:
*/

class Mayan extends Language {

}

/*
6.

Mayan languages share several traits in common including:

    regionsSpoken: "Central America"
    wordOrder: "verb-object-subject"

Tweak the Mayan constructor so that it isn’t necessary to pass in these fields when instantiating a new Mayan language object.

Bear in mind that each language will still require its own name and numSpeakers.

You can do this using super():
*/

  Mayan(String languageName, int speakers) {
    super(languageName, speakers, "Central America", "verb-object-subject");
  }

  /*
7.

Mayan languages have an interesting grammatical feature: ergativity.

Override the getInfo() method for Mayan so that if we called getInfo() on a Mayan language like Ki’che’, we’d get the following info:

Ki'che' is spoken by 2330000 people mainly in Central America.
The language follows the word order: verb-object-subject
Fun fact: Ki'che' is an ergative language.

You could override the method like this:
*/

  @Override
  public void getInfo() {

    System.out.println(this.name + " is spoken by " + this.numSpeakers + " people mainly in " + this.regionsSpoken + ".");
    System.out.println("The language follows the word order: " + this.wordOrder);
    System.out.println("Fun fact: " + this.name + " is an ergative language.");

  }

  /*
8.

Time to test out the tweaks you made to the Mayan class…

Tab back over to Language.java.

In main(), instantiate a new Mayan language of your choice (you can find one here).

Then call getInfo() on the language variable.

Run your code in the terminal to see if the information gets printed. If nothing displays, try compiling your code first.

    For example:
*/
    // inside main()
    Mayan kiche = new Mayan("Ki'che'", 2330000);
    kiche.getInfo();

    To run your code:

    java Language

    To compile your code:

    javac Language.java

9.

The Sino-Tibetan family has the second highest number of native speakers of any language family.

Tab over to SinoTibetan.java and build out an empty SinoTibetan class that inherits from Language.

Your SinoTibetan.java file should have the following code now:

class SinoTibetan extends Language {

}

10.

Like the Mayan language family, Sino-Tibetan languages share several traits in common. In this case:
*/
    regionsSpoken: "Asia"
    wordOrder: "subject-object-verb"
/*
Build a constructor for SinoTibetan that so that it isn’t necessary to pass in these fields when instantiating a new SinoTibetan language object.

Remember — each language will still require its own name and numSpeakers.

You can do this using super():
*/

SinoTibetan(String languageName, int speakers) {
  super(languageName, speakers, "Asia", "subject-object-verb");
}

/*
11.

So that word order thing? There is actually a split in the Sino-Tibetan family on this.

It turns out that at some point (a long time ago) the Chinese languages (among a few others) switched the object and verb order. So they now follow a subject-verb-object pattern. Hmm… How can we handle this?

One (imperfect) tactic is to check if the language’s name field contains "Chinese". There’s a Java string method to check if a string contains a substring.

In the constructor, below where you called super(), change the wordOrder to "subject-verb-object" if this.name contains "Chinese".

    Here’s our solution for this:
*/

      SinoTibetan(String languageName, int speakers) {
        super(languageName, speakers, "Asia", "subject-object-verb");
        if (languageName.contains("Chinese")) {
          this.wordOrder = "subject-verb-object";
        }
      }

 /*
    Want to go a step further? You can do this for each language group that split off from the original order.

Wrapping up

12.

Test out the SinoTibetan class by instantiating two new Sino-Tibetan language objects of your choosing:

    One Chinese (e.g., “Mandarin Chinese”)
    One non-Chinese (e.g., Burmese)

Then call getInfo() on each language variable.

Run your code in the terminal to see if the information gets printed. If nothing displays, try compiling your code first.
*/

// inside main()
  SinoTibetan mandarin = new SinoTibetan("Mandarin Chinese", 1110000000);
  mandarin.getInfo();
  SinoTibetan burmese = new SinoTibetan("Burmese", 43000000);
  burmese.getInfo();

Congrats on all your work with Java Inheritance and Polymorphism! You’ve built out some useful classes for a linguist out there.

BONUS

There are many more language families you could create and there is a lot more you can do here. Check the hint for some ideas to make your Language Inheritance project even better.

    Build an array or ArrayList of several language objects and loop through them to call getInfo().
    Add new methods that allow users to set a specific region, change the number of speakers, or modify the word order.
    Create several more language family classes that pertain to languages you’re interested in.
    Map out the sign language families.
    Add in further linguistic features (e.g., which genders are used, whether the language is tonal, etc.).
